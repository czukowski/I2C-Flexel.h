I2C-Flexel.h library
====================

This library provides API for interaction with the [I2C-Flexel](http://www.web4robot.com/ArduinoShield.html)
Arduino Shield (note: I2C-FLEXEL name is © [www.web4robot.com](http://www.web4robot.com)).

The repo is a [Atmel Studio 6](http://www.atmel.com/microsite/atmel_studio6/default.aspx) solution directory.
Uses [Wire.h](https://github.com/czukowski/Wire.h) library.

Has no evidence of working as of yet, since there are no unit tests at the moment, due to difficulties with
running them on Atmel Studio 6's AVR Simulator.
